# simple-vue-app

When doing inference on video streams or images, it can be tricky at times to customize the UI the way you want. For this reason, it is sometimes easier to work with a real frontend framework for the UI, while keeping your inference models on the server. This repo serves as a boilerplate for the frontend.
